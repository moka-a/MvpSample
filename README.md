## MvpSample - MVP in Java

### Summary
This is my sample 'TODO App' to demonstrate MVP pattern for learning perposes.

The contents of the screen and the app has made a similar reference to Google's sample project. [https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture)

Please let me know if I am doing something badly or if there is a way to improve something.
Thanks.
